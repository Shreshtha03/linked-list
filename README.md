# linked-list
This project implements a Linked List data structure. A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements, called nodes, are stored in a non-contiguous memory location. Each node contains two parts:

Data: The actual value or data the node stores.
Next: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
